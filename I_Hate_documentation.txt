Current features and stats on V0.2
  -scraper can scan multiple matches and stages. It only needs the over all results page URL and can scan from there. As of 1.1 there is NO function
  to detect duplicate matches. This will be added at some point soon. Right now, if it is run it will go through all wyco matches April 2025 to
  present
  
  -PSC1-2.1 has been depricated and is only around for reference if some kind of specific issue pops up that wasn't present in that version

  -Admin.py is in early stages. It is an admin panel that is accessible through streamlit like the dashboards. It allows for easy viewing of names
  wyco numbers, membership status, etc.

  -import_shooters.py imports shooters names, wyco numbers, and current membership status from wyconumbers.csv

  -match_urls.txt is where matches are input. Scraper ignores lines that start with # so you can lable

  -pointsv2.py calculates current wyco scores. This must be run after every match import

  -classify_shooters.py well, classifies shooters. This must also be run every time there is an import

  -fix_duplicates.py will scan the DB looking for shooters with the same name and merge profiles. This is useful for if someone signs up under
  a different spelling or capitalization

  -Merge_TJ is depricated and will be removed in V0.3
